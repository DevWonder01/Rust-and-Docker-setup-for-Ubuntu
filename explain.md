Development Environment Setup Guide
This README.md provides a step-by-step guide to set up a comprehensive development environment on a Debian-based Linux system (like Ubuntu or Kali Linux). This setup includes Rust, essential build tools, and Docker with Docker Compose.

1. Install Rust Programming Language
Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. We'll use rustup, the official Rust toolchain installer.

Install rustup and the Rust toolchain:
This command downloads and executes the rustup installation script. Follow the on-screen prompts (usually selecting option 1 for default installation).

curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

Update your shell environment:
After rustup finishes, you need to update your shell's PATH to include Cargo's binary directory. You can either restart your terminal or run:

source "$HOME/.cargo/env"

2. Install Essential Build Tools
These tools are crucial for compiling various software, including Rust projects that might depend on C/C++ libraries.

Update package lists:
Always a good practice before installing new packages.

sudo apt update

Install build-essential:
This meta-package includes gcc, g++, make, and other tools required for compiling software from source.

sudo apt install build-essential

3. Install Additional Development Dependencies
These packages might be required for specific projects, especially those involving Perl scripting or secure communications (SSL/TLS).

sudo apt-get install -y \
    perl \
    perl-base \
    perl-modules \
    build-essential \
    libssl-dev \
    pkg-config

perl, perl-base, perl-modules: Core Perl interpreter and its modules.

build-essential: (Included again for completeness, but likely already installed from step 2).

libssl-dev: Development files for OpenSSL, necessary for compiling applications that use SSL/TLS.

pkg-config: A helper tool used when compiling applications and libraries.

4. Install libudev-dev
This library provides development files for udev, which manages device events in Linux. It's often required by Rust crates that interact with hardware (e.g., USB devices).

sudo apt-get install libudev-dev

5. Install Docker
Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.

Install necessary packages for Docker's repository:
These packages are needed to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS.

sudo apt-get install \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release

Add Docker's official GPG key:
This verifies the authenticity of Docker packages.

sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

Set up the stable Docker repository:
This command adds the Docker stable repository to your system's apt sources.

echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

Update apt package index again:
After adding the new repository, update your package list.

sudo apt-get update

Install Docker Engine:
This installs Docker Community Edition, its CLI, and containerd.io.

sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

Add your user to the docker group:
This allows you to run Docker commands without sudo. You'll need to log out and log back in for this change to take effect.

sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

6. Install Docker Compose
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

Download Docker Compose:
This downloads the latest stable version of Docker Compose to /usr/local/bin/.

sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

Apply executable permissions:
Make the downloaded file executable.

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

Change ownership (optional but good practice):
This ensures your user owns the docker-compose executable.

sudo chown $USER /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

Verify Docker Compose installation:
Check the installed version to confirm it's working.

docker-compose --version

Important Notes:

Reboot/Relog: After adding your user to the docker group, you must log out and log back in (or reboot your system) for the changes to take effect and to be able to run docker commands without sudo.

Internet Connection: All these commands require an active internet connection to download packages.

sudo Usage: Be mindful that sudo grants administrative privileges. Only run commands with sudo when necessary and if you understand their purpose.
